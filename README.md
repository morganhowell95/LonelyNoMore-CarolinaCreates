# LonelyNoMore-CarolinaCreates
In spirit of teaching a workshop full of curious comp sci goers, I decided to use a simple API that demonstrates GET requests using the python library requests

Workshop Syllabus:
1. Basic Terminal commands
2. Working with the git in the terminal
3. Motivation for public keys and RSA encryption
4. Using what we learned to make a talking bot!


Installing homebrew (package manager for Mac):

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Installing pip (package manager for Python):
sudo easy_install pip

<h2>Dependencies required for the Einstein Bot:</h2>

-requests library: "sudo pip install requests" 

-pyopenssl library: "sudo pip install pyopenssl"

-urllib3 library: "sudo pip install urllib3"

-certifi library: "sudo pip install certifi"

-ndg-httpsclieant and pyasn1 libraries: "sudo pip install ndg-httpsclient pyasn1"

<h5>To run the program: "python LonelyNoMore.py"</h5> 

Bonus points for checking out the BabyBoy branch and making it smarter!

**Note: You may run the file "ListLocalLibraries.py" to list all the modules you have installed (locally) for Python!
