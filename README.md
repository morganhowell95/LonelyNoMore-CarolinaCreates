In spirit of teaching a workshop full of curious comp sci goers, I decided to use a simple API that demonstrates GET requests using the python library requests

Workshop Syllabus:
1. Basic Terminal commands
2. Working with the git in the terminal
3. Motivation for public keys and RSA encryption
4. Using what we learned to make a talking bot!


installing homebrew:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
